“If you use stats you have designed a bad experiment.”  Hubel and Wiesel, 1981 Nobel Prize Winners.
 
This course will introduce statistical principles widely used in the behavioral, social, psychological and brain sciences. The course will both introduce concepts and provide MatLab tutorials that will help translating the concepts into practice. There will be both lectures to introduce the theory behind statistical principles and tutorials to learn how to implement the principles written in MATLAB. Topics will include experimental design, descriptive statistics such as the histogram, average, standard deviation, correlation, regression, the root mean square error, plotting and data visualization, probability, standard error, error-bars, confidence intervals, accuracy, reliability, bootstrap, cross-validation. The course will focus on non-parametric computational approaches.
